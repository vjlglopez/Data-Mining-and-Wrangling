# Data-Mining-and-Wrangling

This is the repository of my compiled data mining and wrangling exercises for a course under the Master of Science in Data Science program. It is divided into two different sections where the first DMW is focused more on exercises about Data Mining specifically Web Scraping and doing API calls, while the second DMW is focused more on different clustering methods and Recommender Systems.
